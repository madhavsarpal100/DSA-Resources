Linked List advantages over arrays:
1) Variable Size, hence better memmory efficiency
2) Easy to insert/delete intermediate elements

Disadvantages :
1)Extra Space required for pointer along with each element
2)Reverse traversal is very difficult, making doubly linked list means more space is required for two pointers with each element
3)Doesnt help in efficient usage of cache as locality of refrence principle works well for arrays. A cached block of memory might not contain any other useful element (apart from the element accessed which caused caching )as succesive elements are stored at different places in memory
4)Accesing elements in a long linked list might be slow
